# Investment-Calculator
This repository includes multiple financial calculator classes—SIPCalculator, CagrCalculator, CommercialCalculator, FutureValue, and EMICalculator—each providing a dedicated panel for specific computations. The CalculatorPage class serves as the main interface, using a CardLayout to integrate all calculator panels into a Frame, enables navigation.
